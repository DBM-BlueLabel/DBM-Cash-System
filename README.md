<b>Cash & Gamble System</b>
<br>Hi everyone, Recently, I saw a lot of users asking for a points system with a gambling system. So, I decided to publish the <br>system I did a while ago, at the beginning of my way in DBM.

<b>The Project Includes: </b>
<br><b>↦ Cash System:</b>
<br>Every message that member sends in the server he receives 1 cash.
<br>He can check how much cash he has by typing: !cash.
<br>Also, he can check how much cash a member has by typing: `!cash <@MentionMember>`. Members can send cash to other members by the command: `!transfer <@MentionMember> <Amount>`. 
<br>Futhermore, a member can send another member cash that they have by typing: !transfer <@MentionMember> <Amount>.
<br>In the transfer action, normal players must pay taxes ( 10% ), but premium members don't have to pay taxes.

<b>↦ Bank System:</b>
<br>By typing: `!deposit <Amount> || !withdraw <Amount>`, you can deposit or withdraw your cash from the bank.
 
<b>↦ Gambling System:</b>
<br>By typing: `!gamble <Amount>`, the bot will generate a number and check if the member wins or loses.
<br>If member has the role "Premium" he has a 10% higher gamble chance!
<br>In the Gamble system, moderators with "Kick Members" permission can block member from gambling and then he can't gamble.
<br>They also can unblock the member: `!blockgamble <@MentionMember> || !unblockgamble <@MentionMember>`

<b>↦ Cash Leader Board:</b>
<br>By typing: `!moneyboard <Limit>` you can see who is the richest man in town.

<b>↦ [NEW] Edit Cash:</b>
<br>By typing: `!editcash <@MentionMember> <set|remove|add> <amount>` you can edit the member's cash amount.

<b>↦ [NEW] Jackpot System:</b>
<br>Usage: `[Prefix]jackpot <Prize Amount> <Entrance Cost> <Max Players to end>`.
<br>Members with the Premium Role will enjoy from no taxes in the prize, but members without the Premium Role the Jackpot will take 10% of the prize.

<b>↦ [NEW] Thief System:</b>
<br>Usage: `!thief <@MentonMember>`.
<br>At the beginning, The thief will give the member alert that he has to pay 10,000 cash. 
<br>After he paid to the thief, members with the Premium Role will enjoy from 30% chance to success the mission, the others will have to get by with 20%.
<br>If the thief success, The command author will enjoy from the loot with the thief cut of 30%, but Premiums will enjoy from thief cut of only 10%.
